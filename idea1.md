Idea #1

1) Research Question

How do the number/type of roads/factories in an area impact the number of air quality and asthma/lung health issues? 

2) Data source, with details about how you will get the data, what variables the dataset has or you will create etc. This can get pretty long, which is fine!

3) What you will do with the data, EDA, model specification.
